Care for Your Brain: A Browser-Based Early Cognitive Decline Assessment Tool

Overview:

Care for Your Brain is an open-source, browser-based web application designed to assist in the early detection of cognitive decline (such as dementia) by analyzing speech patterns and eye-tracking data. The tool generates an interpretable report using GPT-4 and provides visual feedback to users on how their scores compare to healthy baselines.

Features
Speech Analysis

Measures pitch variability, volume consistency, tone stability, and fluency.

Scores each metric from 0‚Äì100%, where 100% indicates optimal performance (close to healthy baseline).

Uses either real-time audio analysis or simulated metrics if no audio is provided.

Plots performance visually with color-coded status indicators (green/orange/red).

Eye Tracking Tests

Saccadic Test: Measures eye movement responsiveness by following a moving object.

Fixation Test: Measures stability of gaze on a static object.

Pupil Test: Simulates or collects average pupil size data.

Scores each metric and computes an aggregate ‚ÄúEye Score‚Äù.

Report Generation

GPT-4 generates a clear, two-table summary of all results.

Indicates whether results suggest low, moderate, or high cognitive risk.

No diagnosis‚Äîjust early insights and a recommendation to seek clinical evaluation if needed.

Frontend & Backend Integration

Frontend uses MediaPipe JS for real-time facial landmark tracking.

Backend is built with Flask, uses Librosa and NumPy for signal processing, and connects to OpenAI‚Äôs API for reporting.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, JavaScript, MediaPipe Face Mesh (JS), Web Audio API

Backend: Python 3, Flask, NumPy, Librosa, Matplotlib, GPT-4 (OpenAI API)

Visualization: Matplotlib plots returned as base64-encoded images

Speech Input: Browser-based audio + optional speech recognition

Session Handling: Flask-Session
